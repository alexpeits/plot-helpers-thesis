"""
This module is used to determine the values that the dimmer
must be set to, in order to achieve various levels of power
dissipation (in this case, the levels 0,10...90,100%).

Because P(t)=V(t)*I(t), it is true that we can determine the
power dissipation in a specific amount of time by integrating
this equation. Here, we integrate for half a period of the
mains supply, because that is the period of the power (the
period of sin squared).

Then, for each value we want to determine, we brute-force the
solution by comparing the desired result to the result of each
iteration (the precision is user-determined). The mean value
is mapped through the MIN and MAX values of the dimmer, thus
providing us with a result - of course with an error.
