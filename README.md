`poly_fit.py` takes some power measurements and produces a second degree
least squares fit curve, according to the expected power measurements.
It accepts input (currently a value between 0-40W), and also produces
a static plot.

`power_estimate.py` was used to determine which dimmer value gives
which power consumption.

`dimmer_auto.py` is an interactive graph that uses matplotlib, and
helps understand how a modern dimmer works.
